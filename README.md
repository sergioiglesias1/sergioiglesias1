### Hey there! 👋  
I’m Sergio, an economist exploring the world of data science 📈.

I work with datasets to uncover insights and build predictive models 💻.

I've worked on several projects, but my favorite one is [bank-campaign-predictor](https://github.com/sergioiglesias1/bank-campaign-predictor).

I’m always learning new techniques, experimenting with projects, and looking for ways to collaborate on data-driven solutions ⚡.

This is a fresh profile where I’ll be sharing my projects and experiments, all built from scratch and fully documented.
