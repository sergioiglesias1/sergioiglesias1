### Hey there! 👋  
I’m Sergio, an economist exploring the world of data science 📈.  

I work with datasets to uncover insights and build predictive models.  

My main tech stack is Python 🐍, R 📈, SQL 🗄️, and MongoDB 🍃, which I use for modeling, visualization, and data exploration.  

I've worked on several projects, but my favorite one is [bank-campaign-predictor](https://github.com/sergioiglesias1/bank-campaign-predictor).

I’m always learning new techniques, experimenting with projects, and looking for ways to collaborate on data-driven solutions ⚡.
